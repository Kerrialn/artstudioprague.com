                            Martin Newham is a British-born contemporary artist and qualified architect, known for
                            producing large-scale abstract artworks that investigate the emotional impact of texture,
                            random patterns, and surface experimentation. Based between Prague and Greece, Martin works
                            from two dedicated studios and exhibits internationally across Europe and beyond.<br><br>

                            The artist's creative journey began at art college in the UK, where early explorations in
                            form and abstraction laid the foundation for a lifelong visual practice. A decade later, a
                            parallel interest in structure and space led to architectural studies, resulting in
                            professional qualification and an architectural career that would take Martin to Azerbaijan
                            and other former Soviet countries. These environments—both culturally rich and visually
                            complex—continue to influence the artist’s visual language and conceptual approach.<br><br>

                            Despite the demands of architecture, art has remained a central pursuit, resurfacing
                            persistently over the years. The majority of Martin’s works are large-format, immersive
                            pieces that reject formal composition in favour of randomness, chance, and intuitive
                            process. These abstract or abstracted forms are less about representation and more about
                            triggering emotional and sensory reactions in the viewer.<br><br>

                            The artist employs a wide range of experimental techniques and materials, particularly
                            freestyle gilding using wafer thin and highly reflective metal sheets—designed to push the
                            boundaries of tactility, perception, and viewer response. Central to the practice is a
                            fascination with how people engage emotionally with random patterns, textures, and layered
                            surfaces that defy easy interpretation.<br><br>

                            Exhibitions in Azerbaijan, Turkey and the Czech Republic have introduced this evolving body
                            of work to an international audience. Responses from these diverse cultural settings
                            continue to shape the artist's creative direction.<br><br>

                            Now living and working between Prague and Greece, Martin Newham bridges the worlds of
                            architecture and contemporary art, creating work that reflects both disciplines while
                            belonging fully to neither. Their art is a space of inquiry—exploring the interplay between
                            control and spontaneity, material and emotion, and the deeply human instinct to find meaning
                            in the unpredictable.<br><br>

                            Martin’s portfolio includes a growing collection of large-scale abstract artworks, available
                            for exhibition, collection, and collaborative projects.
